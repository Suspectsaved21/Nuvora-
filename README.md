## üõ† Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Xcode 15.0 or later
- iOS 16.0 or later
- Swift 5.9 or later
- Supabase account

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Suspectsaved21/Nuvora-.git
cd Nuvora-
```

### 2. Supabase Configuration

The app is pre-configured with the following Supabase settings in `Info.plist`:

- **Project URL**: `https://nuyamkzxwnbmkhdvidwi.supabase.co`
- **Anon Key**: Already configured (replace with your actual key)
- **Twilio Verify Service SID**: `VA449ab0d4938f08da0bab897e6885c163`

#### Required Supabase Tables

Create the following table in your Supabase database:

```sql
-- Rooms table
CREATE TABLE rooms (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    participants INTEGER DEFAULT 1,
    max_participants INTEGER DEFAULT 8,
    is_private BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    mood TEXT DEFAULT 'chill',
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Enable Row Level Security
ALTER TABLE rooms ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Allow all operations for authenticated users
CREATE POLICY "Allow all operations for authenticated users" ON rooms
    FOR ALL USING (auth.role() = 'authenticated');
```

#### Enable Realtime

Enable realtime for the rooms table in your Supabase dashboard:

1. Go to Database ‚Üí Replication
2. Add the `rooms` table to realtime

### 3. Phone Authentication Setup

The app uses Supabase Auth with phone/SMS verification:

1. In your Supabase dashboard, go to Authentication ‚Üí Settings
2. Enable Phone authentication
3. Configure your Twilio credentials (if using Twilio)
4. The app is already configured with the Twilio Verify Service SID

### 4. Install Dependencies

The app uses Swift Package Manager. Dependencies should be automatically resolved when you open the project in Xcode.

Required packages:
- `supabase-swift` (already configured)

### 5. Build and Run

1. Open `Nuvora.xcodeproj` in Xcode
2. Select your target device or simulator
3. Build and run the project (‚åò+R)

## üì± Features

### Authentication
- Phone number verification via SMS
- Secure session management
- Automatic auth state persistence

### Room Management
- Create public/private rooms
- Set room capacity and mood
- Real-time participant tracking
- Search and filter rooms

### Real-time Features
- Live presence tracking
- Mood updates in real-time
- Connection status monitoring
- Automatic reconnection

### User Experience
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Confetti celebrations
- Ambient sound effects
- Responsive design

## üèó Architecture

### Key Components

- **NuvoraApp.swift**: Main app entry point with auth state management
- **SupabaseManager.swift**: Centralized Supabase client management
- **LivePresenceManager.swift**: Real-time presence and mood tracking
- **AuthViewModel.swift**: Authentication state and logic
- **RoomViewModel.swift**: Room management and operations

### Design Patterns

- MVVM architecture
- Reactive programming with Combine
- Modern Swift concurrency (async/await)
- Proper memory management
- Error handling best practices

## üß™ Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist

1. **Authentication Flow**
   - [ ] Enter phone number and receive SMS
   - [ ] Verify code and navigate to home screen
   - [ ] Sign out and return to login

2. **Room Management**
   - [ ] Create a new room with different moods
   - [ ] View room list and search functionality
   - [ ] Join existing rooms

3. **Real-time Features**
   - [ ] Join room and see presence updates
   - [ ] Change mood and verify real-time updates
   - [ ] Leave room and verify cleanup

4. **Error Handling**
   - [ ] Test with invalid phone numbers
   - [ ] Test with network disconnection
   - [ ] Test with invalid room data

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables

The app reads configuration from `Info.plist`. For production deployment, consider using Xcode build configurations:

1. Create build settings for different environments
2. Use `$(SUPABASE_URL)` and `$(SUPABASE_ANON_KEY)` in Info.plist
3. Set actual values in Xcode build settings

### Security Considerations

- Never commit real API keys to version control
- Use environment-specific configurations
- Implement proper Row Level Security in Supabase
- Validate all user inputs
